### Introduction

I'm trying so hard to get people on the bandwagon of clearing and restarting their R sessions frequently. If there's anything you can do to ensure the integrity of your code, it's restarting the R session, clearing your console screen, and re-running your code.  

This practice ensures that you always start from a clean slate when you run your analysis. If you start your analysis with objects in your workspace and your code relies on that workspace, chances are that your analysis will fail to deliver, or you get unexpected (often wrong) results from the code you just run.  

### Restarting

Restarting deletes all the objects you have in your workspace. 

Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+F10`
Mac: `Command+Shift+F10`
