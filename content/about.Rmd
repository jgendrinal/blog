## About me

Hi! You can call me Francis. I work in consulting for banks and similar companies. Much of what I do is data import, cleanup, analysis, and presentation for the clients we serve. I write this blog to document my journey in getting better at working with data, while working at a full-time job.

Me, early in the office ahead of my manager. I sent him this photo shortly after.

Python and R are favorites, but R is my tool of choice. Partly because it was taught in college. But also because the R community produces really great tools that are just not available yet elsewhere.  

## Why "data salaryman"?

Fancy deep learning models, "big data" infrastructures, and flashy visualizations are not that interesting to me. There are data problems in front of the firm and our clients that have to be dealt with before we get there. They include cleaning messy data we inherit, creating meaningful visualizations and reports, and convinving management that a data strategy is important.  

*These are the things that professionals working with data deal with every day. This site is about that work, particularly mine. Hopefully, the people reading this can learn something about the unique challenges working with data, and, hopefully, how those challenges can be overcome.*  

Much of my work is centered around simple data cleaning, nonchalant visualizations, and linear models. The other part is in creating tools both the firm and the banks can use to do their best work.  

There are two worlds in the data space right now. One side is what you could consider more "mature". This is where the more complex and/or cutting-edge work in data is taking place. Here we find neural networks architectures, ETL work, the use of tools like Spark and Hadoop, etc. The second world is that of businesses (both large and small) who are using Excel and may have their toes in R, Python or similar languages. Their sort of data work is much more humble. They tend to use only linear models, very simple visualizations, and usually use code as a support to generate their numbers they copy paste in Word or Excel.  

I consider myself part of the second camp. Many of these companies are still in the second camp. They have data working systems but are not agile enough to maximize their value or minimize their downside risk. It was during the popularization of working with data (famously known as "data science") that people now understand what more could be done. Because a lot of companies did not see this coming, they were not prepared for it. And because companies here are generally not competitive, management has a general inertia towards change.
