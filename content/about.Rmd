## About me

Hi! You can call me Francis. I do data work for banks, credit companies and similar businesses. I write this blog to document my journey in getting better at working with data, while working at a full-time job.

Me, early in the office ahead of my manager. I sent him this photo shortly after.

Python and R are favorites, but R is my tool of choice. Partly because it was taught in college. But also because the R community produces really great tools that are just not available yet elsewhere.  

## Why "data salaryman"?

#### Status quo: Fancy for fancy's sake 

There's a nauseating "race-to-the-edge" in the data space. Data workers are obsessed with using the most sophisticated tech to engineer the most sophisticated models. A lot of  money is spent on making huge office buildings, when a one-room office floor will do just fine. 

Public companies want to chase this hype because they think that by doing so, they can make their stock go up. C-suites will often chase short-term rewards so that they can tell investors how they are chasing "innovation." They will say that they have bought x system and a license for y software, and that they hired z number of data scientists.  

A lot of money, time, and effort is spent and wasted. 

#### Everyday data work

The truth is that all of that is hype. Almost none of the buzzwords will have real impact on the business in the next five years. What is publicized is often a small experimental part of the company that management wants to use to convince investors otherwise. 

Most of the data work in business is still done in Excel (undoubtedly a great tool, but one I've come to personally loathe). Most data storage and analysis is done on a company PC. Most data workers are called by other names e.g. analyst, consultant, controller, specialist, economist, etc. They all do very important data work.  

There are everyday data problems that businesses have to deal with. They include cleaning messy data, creating meaningful visualizations and reports, and aligning the analysis to an overall strategy. Our time and effort should be invested into making data work better for all.  

#### Salaryman: the foundation of our society

Our day to day lives rest on the salarymen who do their work consistently and carefully. This is a reality we take for granted at our peril. Your lunch is the work of many people who have devoted their craft to creating the recipe, cooking the meal, and serving it with hospitality. But to us lunch is just lunch.  

Take that dedication and hardwork away, and most of modern life would be a nightmare. The lights will never be on, the plumbing will not work, your home will fall under its own weight, and the commute to work would be a pain.  

Data is now the way by which we measure the world and make decisions. What is true for ordinary work is true for data work.
